- Saves images with descriptive filenames including slide numbers
- Associates images with relevant text chunks

### Database Integration
- Stores content in ChromaDB vector database
- Enables semantic search across presentation content
- Allows AI-powered question answering about the presentation

## Upload Methods

### Web Interface
1. Access the web interface
2. Click "Add Project to Knowledge Base"
3. Select your .pptx file
4. File will be processed automatically

### API Endpoint
